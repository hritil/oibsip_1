        <h1>Cupcake</h1>
        A cupcake is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup.
        As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied.

            <h2>Vanilla Cake</h2>
            Vanilla is a lot more than just the flavor of your average cookie. Sure, it’s great for making that iconic vanilla cake or cupcake. But did you know there are some pretty neat things about this popular spice? With its sweet, creamy flavor and airy aroma, vanilla is a favorite for many cooks around the world. With origins in tropical regions like Madagascar or Mexico , harvesting this prized bean takes time–and it’s no easy feat! After a long and complicated process including chopping pods down to size with machetes then drying them over fires built from local woods such as sandalwood tree branches, what emerges at last is one of our most popular flavors: vanillin extract.

            <h2> Chocolate Cake</h2>
            There is nothing more satisfying than a rich, chocolatey dessert. Who doesn’t love the flavor of sweet and decadent dark chocolate? But did you know that not only does it taste good – it can make you feel really happy too!
            The perfect chocolate cupcake is a decadent bundle of pleasure for your taste buds. A well-crafted recipe with the right ingredients can produce an amazing cake that makes you want to come back time and again. The rich decadence of chocolate cupcakes is unmatched in the world of sweets. The winning combination, a dark cake mixed with creamy white frosting might be one reason for their popularity but that doesn’t mean they’re all simple variations on each other. Even two different recipes using milk or dark chocolate can go from tasting like something you’ll crave to regretting minutes later if it’s not prepared properly!
